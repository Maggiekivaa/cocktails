This is a simple cocktail ordering system built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
It allows users to log in, view cocktail options, add cocktails to an order, and place an order with a delivery fee.
 The system also lets users view past orders.

 User Login--Users can provide their name, age, and location to log in. They must be 18 or older to proceed with the order.
 
Cocktail Selection--The system fetches cocktail data from the Cocktail DB API (using the Margarita cocktail as a sample). Users can view cocktail names, ingredients, and prices.

Order Creation--Users can add cocktails to their order. A list of selected cocktails is maintained.

Order Summary-- Once the user decides to place an order, the system calculates the total price (including a fixed delivery fee) and displays an order summary.

View All Orders--Users can view a list of all orders placed, including names, locations, items, and total prices.
